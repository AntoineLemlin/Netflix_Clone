# Netflix Clone

### Here is a clone of Netflix I coded in 2 days with ReactJS. It's fully responsive.

---

### If you want to clone it, do a `git clone`, `npm i` then `npm run start`.

### Or click [here](https://distracted-mcclintock-776f91.netlify.app/).

### I still need to add more functionnalities as a search bar.

### Have fun!
